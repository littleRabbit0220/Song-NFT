I have reviewed the scenario and am now at the pid-to-stripe-coustomer-id endpoint.
I have a few questions.
First I need the stripe private key and public key.
Second, I need a way to get user information from a token stored in local storage. Because I have to create stripe customer based on this user information.
Let me explain those problems kindly.
